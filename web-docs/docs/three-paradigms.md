# Smart Contract Paradigms ðŸ“—

Smart contracts are self-executing, immutable pieces of code that automate and enforce the execution of predefined agreements on a blockchain. These agreements can range from simple transactions to complex decentralized applications (DApps). To better understand the implementations in this project, let's explore three primary smart contract paradigms:

## Account-Based Paradigm

The Account-Based paradigm, exemplified by [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) and many other blockchain platforms, operates differently from the UTXO model.

In this paradigm:

- **State Management**: accounts maintain balances and can execute code. These accounts can be externally owned accounts, controlled by private keys, or contract accounts, controlled by the code of a smart contract.
- **State Transitions**: contracts are executed by sending transactions to their respective addresses. Contracts can store and modify their own state, which is maintained on the blockchain.
- **Flexibility**: account-based systems are highly flexible and can accommodate complex smart contract logic.

Within the Account-Based paradigm, we can further categorize smart contracts into two main types: Stateless and Stateful contracts.

### Stateful Contracts

Stateful contracts are contracts that maintain and manage their own state. They can store data, update it based on transactions, and execute complex logic.
Stateful contracts are suitable for applications that require persistent storage and complex business logic, such as games, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and more.

### Stateless Contracts

Stateless contracts are contracts that do not maintain their own state. They execute deterministic functions based solely on their input parameters and the blockchain's current state that is stored in other accounts and passed to contracts as input.

### UTXO Based Paradigm

The UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) based paradigm is famously associated with Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies.

UTXOs are unspent transaction outputs that are created when a transaction is executed and they are consumed when a new transaction is executed.

In this paradigm each transaction consumes one or more UTXOs and creates one or more new UTXOs and each UTXO can only be consumed once.

UTXO-based systems are very simple. However, they can be less flexible for complex operations.

Understanding these smart contract paradigms is crucial when developing blockchain applications, as they influence how contracts handle state, transitions, and security. In the following sections, we'll explore how each of these paradigms has been applied to our Tic Tac Toe game, providing real-world examples of their capabilities and limitations.
