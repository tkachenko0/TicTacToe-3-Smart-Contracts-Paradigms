# Acknowledgments üôè

This project drew inspiration from the speakers and content of the [4th Scientific School on Blockchain & Distributed Ledger Technologies](https://dlt-school.github.io) held at the University of Cagliari.

Here are some of the resources that we found particularly useful:

- [Massimo Bartoletti's](https://github.com/bitbart) provided [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Zw9cQ5CvJUYoig7vU1lFYrRPqV_U2YzYCfWXas2XEXo/edit#slide=id.p)
- [UTXO vs. Account-Based Chains](https://academy.glassnode.com/concepts/utxo#)
- [A Deep Dive into Solana Account Model](https://medium.com/@lianxiongdi/a-deep-dive-into-solana-account-model-1-introduction-7b0408656593)
