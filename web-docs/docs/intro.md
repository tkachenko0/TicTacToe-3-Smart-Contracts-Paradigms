# Tutorial Intro 👋

Hello, in this repository, we explore the three fundamental smart contract paradigms: 
- UTXO-based
- Account-Based 
    - Stateless
    - Stateful

The aim of this project is to provide a comprehensive understanding of these smart contract paradigms and their real-world implications. By scaffolding a familiar game (Tic Tac Toe) in each paradigm, we offer practical insights into the differences, challenges, and advantages of each approach.

So we will provide an overview of the Tic Tac Toe game implemented in those three different smart contract paradigms. Each implementation serves as a practical demonstration of how these paradigms handle state, transitions, and logic execution.

Don't worry, we won't bore you with a tutorial on how to play Tic Tac Toe – we trust that you've all mastered it during those 'productive' school days when lessons just couldn't compete with this classic game. 😉
