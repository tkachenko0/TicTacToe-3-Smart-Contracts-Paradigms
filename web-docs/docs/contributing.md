# Contributing ðŸ™Œ

We welcome contributions to this project! If you're interested, here is an idea: note that while we have implemented Tic Tac Toe game for [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) using [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org) (Statefull) and for [Solana](https://solana.com) using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) with the [Anchor framework](https://www.anchor-lang.com) (Stateless), we currently only have a scaffolded pseudocode for the UTXO-based paradigm. If you're interested in contributing, you can implement the UTXO-based Tic Tac Toe game in a real-world blockchain platform, such as [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/), [Cardano](https://cardano.org), etc..
